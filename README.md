# pomodoro-timer

This project is part of [The Odin Project's Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project). In the curriculum, this is designed as a pair programming exercise. Due to an inability to find a partner in a short time span and my desire to move forward with the curriculum, I chose to do the project on my own.

## project goals
The main goal of this project is to develop a comfortable workflow in front-end development and to practice dictating code as I write. Secondarily, the goal is to create a functional pomodoro timer as a website with css, html, and javascript.

## methods
In order to practice the spirit of pair programming, without a partner, I am dictating my workflow outloud (to my cat), and taking a break every time my workflow stalls.
